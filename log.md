# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 10, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on relaunching Fitness Buddy in Docker, having trouble with Sequelize errors when running the image.

**Thoughts:** Struggling to understand new technologies but working through it and learning as I go. Still getting back into the routine after taking a small break.

 ### Day 1: February 11, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Narrowed Sequelize issue down to service address, still researching a workaround or solution. Took a break then came back and read up on micro-frontends and how they work with react applications. Also looked into splitting up the frontend and backend into separate containers, but will most likely look more into that when I get closer to utilizing that.

**Thoughts**: I'm mainly getting back into the swing of things, reading up on new technologies and practicing gets my mental state back on the right track.


### Day 2: February 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: This day was spent trying to get through that sequelize error but after 6 hours I couldn't find a solution to my ECONNtimeout error. Incredibly frustrating but might circle back around. I decided I was going to dockerize a MERN stack app that I created previously.

**Thoughts** It is not like me to start something else before finishing another but MERN is something I will be using in the future and it would be a good idea to practice on that instead.

### Day 3: February 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Dockerized my app and had the front end consume the backend. Used my previous MERN stack creation to do this and it proved much easier than using my previous app made with Sequelize. 
**Thoughts** Very rewarding to see it come together with some studying and applying.

### Day 4: February 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: This day was spent storing my docker image in ECS on AWS. Relatively simple but interesting concept to learn about why this is done.

**Thoughts** Not as mentally taxing as dockerizing the application for sure.
