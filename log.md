# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 10, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on relaunching Fitness Buddy in Docker, having trouble with Sequelize errors when running the image.

**Thoughts:** Struggling to understand new technologies but working through it and learning as I go.

 ### Day 1: February 11, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Narrowed Sequelize issue down to service address, still researching a workaround or solution. Took a break then came back and read up on micro-frontends and how they work with react applications. Also looked into splitting up the frontend and backend into separate containers, but will most likely look more into that when I get closer to utilizing that.

**Thoughts**: I'm mainly getting back into the swing of things, reading up on new technologies and practicing gets my mental state back on the right track.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
